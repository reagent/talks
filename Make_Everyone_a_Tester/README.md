# Make Everyone a Tester: Natural Language Acceptance Testing

This is the talk I gave on Developer Day in Washington, DC.  It includes the 
presentation as a PDF along with some examples that use Selenium IDE, Selenium
RC, and Selenium RC with Cucumber.  The sample application itself isn't 
available, but this should give you a good idea of how these tools fit together
and allow you to adapt them to your use.

## Prerequisites

* Ruby (1.8.6 or higher)
* RubyGems
* selenium gem ($ gem install Selenium)
* cucumber gem ($ gem install cucumber)
