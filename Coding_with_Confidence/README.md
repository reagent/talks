# Coding with Confidence: Adding TDD to Your Toolset

This is a talk that I gave as part of the 2009 CMAP Code Camp in Columbia, MD. It includes
the presentation as a PDF, the sample code that I created during the live-coding portion of
the session, and a full narrative of what I discussed. 

## Prerequisites

If you want to run the sample code (located in the `examples` directory), you will need:

* Ruby (1.8.6 or higher)
* Rubygems
* Mocha (gem)
* JSON (gem)

If you're on a platform that doesn't support the native JSON gem, you can use the `json_pure` gem instead.
